# Matrix
This is a simple library I made to do basic vector and matrix math. I have used it in some of my other projects, including my raytracer. To use it, just copy the C and header file over to your project. You may need to link with `-lm` on linux, but other than that I've had no issues linking with MinGW or Visual Studio.
