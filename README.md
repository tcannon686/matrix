# Matrix
This is a simple library I made to do basic vector and matrix math. I have used it in some of my other projects, including my raytracer. To use it, just copy the C and header file over to your project. You may need to link with `-lm` on linux, but other than that I've had no issues linking with MinGW or Visual Studio. You can also compile using a C++ compiler, which features basic wrapper classes. If you want to include C++ support, you must include: matrix.hpp, matrix.h, matrix.cpp, and matrix.c.
